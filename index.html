                    in the rental bikes in the city of Bengaluru, as there were many theft 
                    or simply carry away of helmets by the customers. Our product was made using Arduino and RFID Sensors to detect the helmet, if detected then it ends the ride else if not found
                    it sends an alert message to the respective rental service headquarters.

                    then the product will immediately report to the Cell Phone Head Quarters for eg:

                    Our drone will detect the fire at the early stage and locates the location of that specific area 
                    and then it will report to the nearby foreat office. We are using an image processing algorithm 
                    for fire detection and using the GPS Sensors and Cameras of the Rpi, the drone clicks some pictures

                <h3><span>IEEE Experience</span></h3>
                <p>In 2019, I started my first volunteering for IEEE Student Leadership Forum hosted by IEEE Madras Section as a designer. 
                    I loved my first volunteering completely with my co-friends from the Madras section. <br> Next, Likewise, 
                    I continued my volunteering as an ambassador for various IEEE Events like AHWIESC, IEEE Programming League, IFSFS by IEEE Kerala Section, INSPIRO, etc. 
                    I also serve as IEEE Brand Ambassador. 
                    Later at the AISWLC19, attended for the first time, I met lots of IEEEians and many other speakers where I learned the key points from each of them.
                    <br>
                    In 2020, I got selected as MDC Volunteer at the IEEE Bangalore section and also as a Social Media Coordinator at IEEE Bangalore Section. This was my major volunteering experience where I learned lots of stuff from the team and the co-friends in the Social media team 2020 where I was always being encouraged and supported me to every stuff with love and interest.
                    They never made me feel what I worked for was unworthy.I am also working as a volunteer at Venus Campaign, aiming to give opportunities to entrepreneurship which is initiated by IEEE Kerala Section
                     where I enjoyed thoroughly and loved to work with those fellow partners in a team working for spreading positive vibes to the women entrepreneurs. <br>
                     Later I got an opportunity to volunteer as an Ambassador for the International conference IEEE Rising Stars for the year 2021 hosted by Region 6, where I got to interact with many people outside India and got to know about a conference standard how they conducted it online perfectly and interactively. 
                     That was the best volunteering ever since I joined IEEE and at the end of the volunteering, I was gifted with Amazon Gift Vouchers. <br> Later then, I got a chance to volunteer for IEEE Smart Cities as a Webinar Coordinator with the core team. Now, recently I got selected for the Student Coordination Team of the IEEE Bangalore Section.

                <p>
                    I am currently holding the position of Vice-Chair of IEEE Computer Society BMSIT&M. 
                    My journey of IEEE started in 2018 with the guidance and support from my super seniors Gautama Bharadwaj and Deepa M S who were the Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson of my student branch in 2018. 
                    They motivated and supported me in aspects to do all the activities we love and are interested in. 
                    They always made sure we were involved in all the activities and with their support, that’s where I started my designing skills and started volunteering in the design field.
